## Curious in Artificial intelligence and machine Learning
Hi, I’m **Aarush Goswami** — a 2nd-year Computer Science student at **MIET Jammu**, currently specializing in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**. I'm on a journey to master Python and build a strong foundation for my AI/ML career. This repository documents all the basic Python concepts I've learned and my first beginner-level projects
1 Python Basics
A collection of hands-on practice scripts covering:
- Variables and Data Types
- Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
- Conditional Statements (if/else)
- Loops (for/while)
- Functions
- Exception Handling
- Basic Input/Output

Each code file is written with clarity and focuses on **practical understanding**.

## Project: Patient Health Report Generator
A beginner-friendly Python project that:
- Accepts patient information as input
- Calculates BMI from height and weight
- Generates a structured health report
- Outputs essential details like name, age, gender, ID, and BMI

📁 File: `patient_report_generator.py`

This project helped me connect basic Python concepts with **real-world applications**, and it’s my first step into **project-based learning**.
